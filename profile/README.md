## 👋 Welcome to Cogna

At **Cogna**, we build AI software for the physical world 🏗️⚡

We help the teams running energy, utilities, infrastructure, and construction work smarter by tackling messy, high-stakes operational problems that off-the-shelf tools can’t handle. Our goal is simple (and ambitious): unlock massive productivity gains and let people focus on the work that truly matters.

We’re growing 🚀

We’re looking for curious, driven engineers and operators who love solving hard problems, shipping real systems, and seeing their work make a tangible impact in the real world. If you want ownership, fast learning, and a team that cares deeply about what it builds, you’ll fit right in.

👉 **Come build with us:** https://www.cogna.co/careers
